;; 1.33 You can obtain an even more general version of accumulate by introducing the notion of a filter on the terms to be combined. That is, combine only those terms derived from values in the range that satisfy a specified condition. The resulting filtered-accumulate abstraction take the same arguments as accumulate, together with an additional predicate of one argument that specifies the filter. Write filtered accumulate as a procedure.
